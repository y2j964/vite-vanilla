## General Info

This starter pack provides TailwindCSS, PostCSS, Eslint, Prettier, Babel, and all the bundling you get from Vite. I similarly have made a [Webpack-Tailwind starter pack](https://github.com/y2j964/webpackTailwindStarter), but this starter ditches Webpack for Vite to make things lighter and faster.

## Setup

All of the scripts are the default Vite scripts. So here's what you get:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the dev server.

### `npm run build`

Builds out all assets.

### `npm run serve`

Serves a preview.
